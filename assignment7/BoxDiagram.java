 * File: BoxDiagram.java
 * ---------------------
 * Week 5 Assignment #7: Using interactors (Event Driven Programming)
 * Build a framework for an interactive design tool that allows the user to arrange boxes with 
 * labels on the window. The starting configuration for the program presents an empty graphics 
 * canvas and a control bar containing a JLabel, a JTextField, and three JButtons. 
 * 
 * The most important operation in the program is to be able to add a new box to the screen, 
 * which you do by typing the name of the box in the JTextField and clicking the Add button. 
 * Doing so creates a new labeled box with that name in the center of the window.
 * 
 * For this simple version of the application, you may assume that the box always has constant 
 * dimensions, as specified by the following constant definitions:
 *       private static final double BOX_WIDTH = 120;
 *       private static final double BOX_HEIGHT = 50;
 * Once you have created a labeled box, your program should allow you to move the box as a unit 
 * by dragging it with the mouse. Because the outline and the label must move together, it makes 
 * sense to combine the GRect and GLabel into a GCompound and then use code similar to that in 
 * Figure 10-4 TASOJ, p. 359: (Program to drag objects on the canvas) in the book to implement 
 * the dragging operation.
 * 
 * The ability to create new boxes and drag them to new positions makes it possible to draw box 
 * diagrams containing an arbitrary number of labeled boxes. For example, you could add three 
 * more boxes with names GraphicsProgram, ConsoleProgram, and DialogProgram respectively, and 
 * drag them around to create a diagram of the Program class hierarchy.
 * 
 * The other two buttons in the control strip are Remove and Clear. The Remove button should 
 * delete the box whose name appears in the JTextField; the Clear button should remove all of 
 * the boxes. Note that you do not need to worry about the user trying to create multiple boxes 
 * with the same nameâ€“you can assume that all box names are unique.
